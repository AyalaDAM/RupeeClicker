# Zelda Clicker Game

This project is a clicker game inspired by Cookie Clicker, where the player earns rupees by clicking, can buy items that automatically generate rupees,
and unlock powers and achievements. It features a simple interface and dynamic functionality for an engaging and progressive experience.

- **Upgrades**:
  - Power (increases rupees per click).
  - Wisdom (doubles all item effects).
  - Courage (reduces item prices).
- **Items**: Six types of items generate rupees periodically.
- **Achievement System**: Unlock achievements for key actions with animated notifications.
- **Live UI Updates**: Item prices and quantities update visually in real-time with readable number formatting.
- **Popup Notifications**: Achievements appear from the top corner and disappear after a few seconds.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: Responsive layout and dynamic styling.
